## 🧠 Director's Notes

Repository established as the organizational memory layer. Obsidian vault structure is in place with templates for daily notes, project documentation, and blog ideation. WordPress publishing pipeline is scaffolded but not yet connected.

Primary focus is on establishing capture habits before optimizing the publishing workflow.

## 🚧 Strategic Blockers

| Blocker | Impact | Resolution Path |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| WordPress API not configured | Cannot auto-publish posts | Set up Application Password, add secrets |
| Obsidian vault sync strategy | May lose notes if not synced | Decide: Obsidian Git plugin vs manual commits |

---

## 🎯 Focus for Next Cycle

1. Configure WordPress Application Password and test publishing
2. Establish daily note habit with Obsidian
3. Write first blog post using the pipeline
